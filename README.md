Image Super-resolution Using Deep Learning


 Deep Convolutional Model is superior to perform image super-resolution because SRCNN  achieves  the  highest PSNR  (Peak  Signal  to  Noise  Ratio). It is  a  ratio  of  the maximum possible power of a signal and the  power of corrupting noise that affects the  fidelity  of  its  representation.The  deep  convolutional  model in  SRCNN directly learns  anend-to-end  mapping  between  low and  high-resolution  images  with  little preprocessing.  This  model has  achieved  superior  performance  than  the  state  of  art methods. It    is    also   believed    that    more    performance    can    be    achieved    by experimenting   withmore   filters   and   different   strategies.   Moreover,   with the robustness and simplicity of the model it canalsobe used in various low-level vision problems.
 
 
 PSNR is the Peak  signal-to-noise ratio  (PSNR)  is defined  as  theratio ofthe  maximum  possible power  of  a  signal  and  the  power  of  corrupting  noise  that  affects  the  fidelity  of  its representation.If the value of the PSNR is high the betteristhe model to reconstruct a high-resolution image from a low resolution image.
